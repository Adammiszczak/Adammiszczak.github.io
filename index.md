## Initial post - about me!
Hello :).

My name is Adam Miszczak and I'm SEO Specialist for some time, but my main goal is going to work as Front-end Developer :).

I'm fascinated about various programming languages and web technologies. My hobbies also are militaries, anime, manga, cyber security, air soft gun, computer games, comics, martial arts.

As SEO Specialist I've also done technical tasks, so I had to and decided to learn thing like regex, mysql, php, some servers stuff and other. In the meantime I've learned pure javascript with a bit of React and tried to use it as often as I can at SEO.

At this blog there will be links to my project with some description :)

## SEO Content Orderer

Are you SEO Specialist üíª or SEO üñäÔ∏è Copywriter? Great, because both of you need clear and simple templates to create content orders. This tool will simplify it.

It's made with react and it's only basic version, there are still a lot of thing to do like:

* So far no form validation like (empty inputs, required number of letters, type of data),
* refresh whole app after finalizing order,
* posibility to download the output as doc or txt,
* visual changes,
* login panel,
* store previous content orders at Data Base e.g. Firebase.

## Photovoltaic Calculator

Hello :). As you know I work as SEO Specialist and one of my client has photovoltaic company and domain about photovoltaic cells, solar panels and renewable energy from sun. There are many phrases such like "kalkulator fotowoltaiczny" exact matches, partial matches and synonyms which lead to quite big Google organic traffic, but landing page about "calculator" shouldn't have only optimized content :).

I got a Google Sheet file from client with his own formulas. My goal is bring it to the landing page. Why did I push almost ready calculator in 1 file? The formulas are develop by client and he was afraid somebody could steal source code. That's why firstly I develop it locally, then reworked it a bit and then push. The naming of variables is intentional to let's say "cloak the logic".

First version was made with bootstrap styles, but there are some problems, because bootstrap made conflicts with default layout
of clients domain (Wordpress - Visual Composer). I have to do custom styles and strip bootstrap classes.
