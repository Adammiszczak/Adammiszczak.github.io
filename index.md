## Initial post - about me!
Hello :).

My name is Adam Miszczak and I'm SEO Specialist for some time, but my main goal is going to work as Front-end Developer :).

I'm fascinated about various programming languages and web technologies. My hobbies also are militaries, anime, manga, cyber security, air soft gun, computer games, comics, martial arts.

As SEO Specialist I've also done technical taska, so I had to and decided to learn thing like regex, mysql, php, some servers stuff and other. In the meantime I've learned pure javascript with a bit of React and tried to use it as often as I can at SEO Specialist job.

At this blog there will be links to my project with some description :)
