Hello :). As you know I work as SEO Specialist and one of my client has photovoltaic company and domain about photovoltaic cells, solar panels and renewable energy from sun. There are many phrases such like "kalkulator fotowoltaiczny" exact matches, partial matches and synonyms which lead to quite big Google organic traffic, but landing page about "calculator" shouldn't have only optimized content :).

I got a Google Sheet file from client with his own formulas. My goal is bring it to the landing page. Why did I push almost ready calculator in 1 file? The formulas are develop by client and he was afraid somebody could steal source code. That's why firstly I develop it locally, then reworked it a bit and then push. The naming of variables is intentional to let's say "cloak the logic".

First version was made with bootstrap styles, but there are some problems, because bootstrap made conflicts with default layout
of clients domain (Wordpress - Visual Composer). I have to do custom styles and strip bootstrap classes.
