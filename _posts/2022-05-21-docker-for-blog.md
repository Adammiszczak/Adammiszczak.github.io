Two years ago I decided to start this little blog and you can see the [details](/repo-description/blog-with-jekyll-md). The main problem is I had some issues to install all dependencies at my machine, moreover things like Ruby, new package manager and so on were totaly unknown for me. So developing this blog locally was practically like shooting with closed eyes... I can't set local server to see Live Version after every change. Back then I only heard about Docker and the fact this is related to some "containters"...

Currently I'm learning only backend staff with node.js and I have some tasks related to different ORMs, ODMs. It forced me to install some dependencies, but... This is the moment when I got familiar with Docker :) There is no need to litter my computer. I can use isolated containter with complete enviroment. So I summoned up my issues with GitHub blog :).

Long story short, I added docker support and finally I can do proper developing :)
