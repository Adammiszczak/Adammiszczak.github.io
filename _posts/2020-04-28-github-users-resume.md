This project is one of recruitment task for my application as Junior Front-end Developer. The target is to get data about GitHub users, knowing only name and using Github Api. The skills used at this task are:


* Using fetch to communicate with api (also nested fetches)
* Display fetched data from Github Api
* Responsive design
* A bit of error handling and clearing previous state
* Events handling
* Operations at arrays, objects using dedicated methods
* Making some custom functions

Despite of it's functional I'm going to develop this "app" e.g. using async / await, scopes, performance etc.
