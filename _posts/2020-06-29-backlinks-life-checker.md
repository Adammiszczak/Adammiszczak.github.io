The idea for this small tool were my needs about monitoring backlinks to my clients which I'm positioning and check if those backlinks still exist and contains same anchor texts. The main reason is no payments in comparison to some commercial scrappers or crawlers. 

My needs isn't big, so the tool will work at small scale. Unless you pass thousands of urls. At current state, the tool would rather have some performance problems.

You simply need to pass list of urls with links to your domain. **Check Readme at repository** :)
