This project is another one of recruitment task for my application as Junior Front-end Developer. This time it was from one big company. The task is to create custom Pokedex (pokemon lists). The goals are:

* The app should have list with pagination
* The app should have at least one sort options
* The app should use the PokeApi v2
* The app should be launched by "npm start"
* The app should be compatible with node.js v12
* The app should be fully responsive

I met a few obstacles:
* The PokeApi doesn't enable endpoints to sort data at backend
* There is need for some asynchronic functions for fetches
* Making pagination and sorting at the some time was challenging

Further plans for this app:
* Javascript unit tests, which I have to learn!
* Basic backend
* Ux improvements
* Users login platform


* Check the production version of [React.js Pokedex GH Page Version](https://adammiszczak.github.io/React-pokedex/)
* Check the [React.js Pokedex Repository](https://github.com/Adammiszczak/React-pokedex)
