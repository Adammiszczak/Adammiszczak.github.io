This blog is running on Jekyll which transform plain text into static websites and blogs. Of course you can use your own html, css and so on. The blog itself is hosted on GitHub Pages as you see. 

What is the idea behind this blog? I want to share my repositories with description of tasks, problem and future plan for developments. Also this is good opportunity to learn Jekyll, because it is used as Headless CMS, very similiar to Hugo by the way. 

During developing this blog with Jekyll I hade also opportunity to practise Yaml and Sass.

My goals are:

* Make a blog with posts and subpages
* Make a pagination
* Make some navigation
* Make this as seo friendly as it can

Link for repo is at the top bar left.
