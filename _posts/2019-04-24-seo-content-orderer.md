Are you SEO Specialist 💻 or SEO 🖊️ Copywriter? Great, because both of you need clear and simple templates to create content orders. This tool will simplify it.

It's made with react and it's only basic version, there are still a lot of thing to do like:

* So far no form validation like (empty inputs, required number of letters, type of data),
* refresh whole app after finalizing order,
* posibility to download the output as doc or txt,
* visual changes,
* login panel,
* store previous content orders at Data Base e.g. Firebase.
