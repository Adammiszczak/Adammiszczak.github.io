# About me

My name is Adam Miszczak and I'm SEO Specialist since 2018 (with some digital marketing stuff). Initially I was rather learning rather Frontend stuff than Backend. As Seo Specialist I have opportunity to develop internal tools for my team.

Some time ago, I completely changed my career plans. I was previously employed as a Sales and Customer Service Specialist. However, after working for an IT company, I realized my passion lies in technical work, and now it's my life plan. SEO presents an opportunity for me to achieve this goal.

## Previous state
Beyond my current profession as an SEO Specialist with some programming elements, I have been attending a mentorship program course since June 2021. The mentors involved work in [LocalHost Academy](https://academy.localhost-group.com/). You can read more about :).

During the mentorship program, I am developing my current skills and acquiring new ones. I have frequent contact with coding experts who review my solutions. I aspire to pursue a career path as a Backend TypeScript Developer. Some of the learning areas include:

* JS Functional Programming
* JS OOP
* TS Functional Programming
* TS OOP
* TS in Node & Async
* JS/TS Unit and Integration Tests
* Servers and DBs

## Current state

From 2023 I had a small episode with **Java Backend Programming** :) I used my knowledge from previous experience. You can see my post about [Seo Monitor Tool](https://adammiszczak.github.io/repo-description/github-actions-seo-monitoring-and-automation) I rewrite it to Java using more OOP and good practises. It's easier to maintain, extend and it's tested, because I use TDD way. So it's my first commercial code in Java after 2 months :). But I can't show it, you know why...

Still my main language is Javascript, but this small episode with Java boostet my work abilities, theoretical and practical knowledge.
