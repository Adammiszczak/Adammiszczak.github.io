# About me 

My name is Adam Miszczak and I'm SEO Specialist since 2018 (with some digital marketing stuff), but my main goal is going to work as Node.js Back-end Developer (previously I was learning rather Frontend stuff). As Seo Specialist I have opportunity to develop internal tools for my team.

Some time ago I changed my whole career plans. Namely I was Sales and Customer Service Specialist, but once I've worked for IT company I realized that I wanted to do technical stuff and now it's my life plan.
