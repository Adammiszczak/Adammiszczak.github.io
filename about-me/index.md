# About me

My name is Adam Miszczak and I'm SEO Specialist since 2018 (with some digital marketing stuff), but my main goal is going to work as Back-end Developer (previously I was learning rather Frontend stuff and Backend in Node). As Seo Specialist I have opportunity to develop internal tools for my team.

Some time ago I changed my whole career plans. Namely I was Sales and Customer Service Specialist, but once I've worked for IT company I realized that I wanted to do technical stuff and now it's my life plan.

## Previous state
Beyond my current profession as Seo Specialist with some programming elements, I have attended at mentorship program course since June 2021. The mentors work in [LocalHost Academy](https://academy.localhost-group.com/). You can read more about :).

During mentorship program I develop my current skills and develop new ones. I have very frequent contact with coding experts who make code review for my solutions. I wanted to follow path as Backend TS Developer. Some of learning areas are:

* JS Functional Programming
* JS OOP
* TS Functional Programming
* TS OOP
* TS in Node & Async
* JS/TS Unit and Integration Tests
* Servers and DBs

## Current state from 2023

Now in 2023 I have real opportunity to be **Java Backend Developer, so i started to learn JAVA** :) I use my knowledge from previous experience so I had learn Java tools and syntax. You can see my post about [Seo Monitor Tool](https://adammiszczak.github.io/repo-description/github-actions-seo-monitoring-and-automation) I rewrite it to Java using more OOP and good practises. It's easier to maintain, extend and it's tested, because I use TDD way. So it's my first commercial code in Java after 2 months :). But I can't show it, you know why... But my plan is to do some complex project using Java and Spring. Maybe some linktree clone :) Nevertheless, I'm going to develop it privately and publish it :)
